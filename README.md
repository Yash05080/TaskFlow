# corporate_manager

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

currently i am working on project which can help in managing huge projects in a corporate setting or even in an open source setting. it will help in maintaining a proper work space by providing github like features for commit requests. It will have a built in task manager with grid like leetcode which will work exactly as in leetcode: the more problem you solve, the more brighter your daily report cell. IT has a hierarchical database model where the higher position you are at , the more information you can see about people under you.
people at superior positions like admin and managers can assign task in direct as well as free lance method. the tasks will be worth of some points depending on the difficulty of the task .based on the daily quota of work assigned to the employee , he/she will need to earn points by completing the tasks.
It makes it easier to manage the workflow.
